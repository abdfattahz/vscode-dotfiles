## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- Many bindings are **Vim-aware**, meaning they only work in `Normal` or `VisualLine` mode.
- Some Explorer bindings are single letters (`R`, `C`, `D`, etc.) but only apply **inside the File Explorer**, so they won‚Äôt interfere with normal editing.
- `Ctrl+K` has been repurposed for pane navigation (this disables VS Code‚Äôs default `Ctrl+K ...` chord system).
